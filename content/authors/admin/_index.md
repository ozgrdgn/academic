I am a lecturer and a life-long researcher in ELT. Soon after the college graduation from the ELT department of Bogazici University in 2005, I literally dived into the education business by starting my own company called “Live English” and ran it for 7 years. There, I gained invaluable experiences in teaching both as a teacher and a manager. I am currently working as a Lecturer at Erzincan Binali Yildirim University, teaching ESP (English for Specific Purposes) and EAP (English for Academic Purposes) courses. I am also a PhD candidate at Middle East Technical University.

My research interests include Educational Technology, Mobile Learning, Mobile Assisted Language Learning, Social Media and Language Learning, E-learning, Augmented Reality, and Gamification.
